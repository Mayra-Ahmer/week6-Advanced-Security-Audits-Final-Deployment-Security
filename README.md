# Week 6: Advanced Security Audits & Final Deployment Security

## Project Overview
This project involves performing security audits, ensuring compliance with industry security standards, and preparing a vulnerable web application for secure deployment. Various security tools and best practices were applied, including OWASP ZAP, Nikto, and Lynis for security audits, Docker security for deployment, and final penetration testing using Burp Suite and Metasploit.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **OWASP ZAP**: For dynamic application security testing.
- **Nikto**: A web server scanner to detect vulnerabilities.
- **Lynis**: A security auditing tool for Unix-based systems.
- **Docker**: For containerized application deployment.
- **Burp Suite**: For manual and automated penetration testing.
- **Metasploit**: For testing exploits and vulnerabilities.
